# OncoDataset
Modules to create high fidelity (synthetic) oncology data. 

The purpose of this project is to create programs that can generate a rich, representative, and substantial volume of oncology data. Such synthetic datasets can be used to stress test modules for processing, storage, and computational complexity. This project is part of Jori Health's intiative to build a patient-owned single source-of-truth. Visit www.jori.health for more.
